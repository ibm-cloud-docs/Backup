# Upgrading backup software agent for Windows
{: #UpgradeinWindows}
{: help}
{: support}

The most recent backup agent can be downloaded from your Cloud Backup Portal Dashboard quick links section.
{: tip}

Any agent that's older than the 8.32 version needs to be upgraded because they cannot connect with the Backup portal due to outdated, unsupported TLS functionality. Following the upgrade process ensures that you can upgrade your {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} agent without losing the registration.
{: shortdesc}

As of 25 March 2021, full support of Windows&reg; 2019 is available in the Cloud Backup Portal. Agent version 8.72 is required for this OS.
{: tip}

1. Remote control your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} server that is in need of an {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} upgrade.

3. Click the file that you want.

   The version number is in the file name. Choose the most recent. <br/>{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers separate 32-bit and 64-bit installers. If you have a 64-bit Operating System, download the file with x64 in its name. For example, Agent-Windows-x64-8-32-7901.exe.
